## Game Play with React Icon:
'Game Play with React Icon' is an app where you can interact and play with react icon. This app was developed using HTML 5, CSS 3, JavaScript and React JS 

## Features:
Reversed React Icon Rotation: I've added functionality that changes the rotation direction of the React icon with every user click.

Cursor-Based Icon Sizing: Now, the size of the React icon dynamically adjusts based on the cursor's position on the page.

Mouse Activity Timer: I've implemented a feature that displays the duration the mouse remains stationary within the visible page, below the icon.

Sidebar Toggle: On left top of the screen, click on hamburger to open sidebar where any of the previous changes can be switched on or off.
